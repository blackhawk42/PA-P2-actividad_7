Programaci√≥n Avanzada - Parcial 2: Actividad 6

## Building

Run:

```
gcc EXERCISE.c -o EXERCISE.exe

```

Of course, the only ones I really did, as per the instructions, where 01.c
and 05.c.

The Markdown (.md) files are meant to be read for the answer to its respective
question.

# Running

All exercises except exercise 5 run with:

```
./EXERCISE.exe
```

Exercise 5 requres a number as a command-line argument. For example:

```
./05.exe 50
```

It will also show a little help message if invoked with no arguments.
